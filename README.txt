Orion's Furnace

A multiplayer role playing game

* Dependencies: SDL2 and a C++11 compiler.
* Building: Use a Python 3 version of SCons. Note, the compiler flags are GCC-styled, so if you aren't using GCC or Clang you'll need to adjust them - in which case, please let me know about them.
  * OK, my laptop has a Python 2 version of SCons, so at this stage both are supported.

Licence: AGPLv3. See COPYING for the licence text.
