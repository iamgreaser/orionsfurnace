Orion's Furnace

A multiplayer role playing game

* Dependencies: SDL2 and a C++11 compiler.
* Building: Use CMake 3.7 or higher. Ideally higher as that was released late 2016, and keeping down with Debian Stale's release schedule is a non-goal of this project.

Licence: AGPLv3. See COPYING for the licence text.
